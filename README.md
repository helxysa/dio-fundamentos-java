Of course! Here's a revised version of your README, tailored to your DIO - GFT Java exercises.

DIO - GFT Start Java Exercises 🚀
This repository contains the solutions for the coding challenges and exercises from the GFT Start #5 Java bootcamp, provided by Digital Innovation One (DIO).

📂 Folder Structure
The workspace is organized for Java development in Visual Studio Code:

src: This folder holds all the Java source code files (.java).

lib: This folder is for managing external dependencies or libraries (.jar files).

bin: Compiled Java class files (.class) are automatically generated in this folder.

Note: To customize this structure, you can modify the settings in the .vscode/settings.json file.

⚙️ Dependency Management
This project uses the standard folder-based approach for dependencies. If you need to add any .jar files, simply place them in the lib folder. The JAVA PROJECTS view in VS Code will automatically reference them.
